####Otherwise we should use some other tools that are do memory management to identify useless objects or memory leak, like :
HP OVO
HP J METER
JProbe
IBM Tivoli

####A memory leak in java (who would've though heh?) can occur if you forgot to close a resource, or a reference to an object is not related. e.g.

File/Text buffers not closed. (as was in my case)
Hashmaps keeping reference alive if equals() and hashcode() are not implemented.
Inner classes that reference outer class can leak.(make them static to avoid).

how would you manage the load of your application?
how would you design the s/w?

Question 1. Explain what if your client ask to work on a project outside the specialization ? 

Answer : if you and your colleagues don't have skills, who can work on a project that your client demanded it's better to deny by telling that the project requires
experties, and you don't have the bandwidth. To give a good impression to your client, you can even offer your client to help him/her find someone to do this work.

Question 2. Tell us what will be your reaction if a project you had been trackling is suddenly changed or the deadline moved ?

Answer : The first thing would be to ensured that I have all the facts of these changes as genuine reason before I can inform my team members. 
With everyone aware of the changes, I will have to talk to the teammates and discuss a new way forward that works for all of them.

Question 3. What will be your reaction if an external candidate is hired in your place for this internal position?

Answer : I would appreciate the oppertunity to serve in this internal position within my company. If it does not happen though, I am still committed to seeing our 
company progress and achieve its objective. If not selected, I will definitely work with and offer my full support to whoever might get the chance. I will also
continue looking for any other better position in the field that matches my experience and objectives.

Question 4. How would you handle a conflict between team members?
Answer : I understand that there will always be two sides of a story. This realization makes it possible for me to stay neutral and have an open-mind when handling any
conflict between teammates. A few years ago I had to sort out a conflict where two of my team members were not in terms with each other. I couldn't risk ignoring it, and 
assuming they would sort it out themselves. Instead, I sat them down individually and asked for an explanation. After discussion, we arrived at a reasonable as well as
professional solution that was acceptable for both parties. This is how, I managed to fix the matter.

Question 5. Give us an example of one tough decision you had to make ?

Answer : I believe that the good of the company should always come firstbefore personal feelings. So, sometime back, I was faced with a scenario where I was supposed
to hire a new team member to work on a major project for our company. I narrowed down the selection to 2 qualified candidates. One was a new hire that seemed like an
excellent fit for the job, and the other one was an, established employee that may not have been the right fit for that particular position. The problem was, I considered
him a personal friend. Naturally, I would prefer hiring my friend, but it wouldn't have made sense for the company, hence I ended up hiring the newcomer. When my
friend inquired about it, I explained clearly. This led to a discussion of other oppertunities that were excellent for him. I can say that this was not an easy 
decision then, but all means it was a correct move that I would repeat.
