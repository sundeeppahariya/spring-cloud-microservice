Difference b/w Microservice & Web Service -
In Web Service you don't know where it is going to be used. We expose it as an utility - based on Service Oriented Architecture.
Ex-ip locator, which is deployed some where as an utility, consumers call this service and it reurns the location of that ip.
where as in microservices, you know very well, where it is going to be used.-like amazon/flipkart or book my show.
